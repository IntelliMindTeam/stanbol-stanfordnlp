# The Arabic pipeline for Stanbol uses a different layout
# (1) The PTBLexer as the arabic one does not add start/end position and 
#     begin/after annotations 
# (2) Split the text into Sentences - as one does not need Arabic segmentation
#     for that
# (1) IOB Segmentation as required for Arabic POS tagging
# (3) POS tags sentences
# 
annotators = tokenize, ssplit, segment, pos
